      <p className='w-3/6 ml-64 mt-7  text-center text-xl'>Tic Tac Toe is traditionally played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid. Players take turns placing a mark in one of the cells of the grid. The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally</p>
